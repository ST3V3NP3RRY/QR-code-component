### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

By reviewing other developers code, and some Googling, I learned to calculate and use rem values for font-sizing, margin and padding.

### Continued development

I want to learn more about CSS custom properties as I have seen a number developers use them in their solutions.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11352783/how-to-calculate-rem-for-type#:~:text=If%20you%20want%2032px%2C%20then,then%2024%20%2F%2012%20%3D%202%20.) - This helped me to understand how to calculate rem values for use throughout my project.
