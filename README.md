## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./images/QR code component)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

By reviewing other developers code, and some Googling, I learned to calculate and use rem values for font-sizing, margin and padding.

### Continued development

I want to learn more about CSS custom properties as I have seen a number developers use them in their solutions.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11352783/how-to-calculate-rem-for-type#:~:text=If%20you%20want%2032px%2C%20then,then%2024%20%2F%2012%20%3D%202%20.) - This helped me to understand how to calculate rem values for use throughout my project.
